I have created a vibrant and user-friendly website to showcase all the details about the shop. The site features an engaging About section, a comprehensive Menu to highlight the offerings, clearly displayed Store Hours, and an easy-to-navigate Contact Us page for customer inquiries. The Location section provides all the necessary information to find the shop. Additionally, customers can share their valuable feedback through a simple form that asks for their Name and Email ID. Built with HTML and enhanced with eye-catching CSS, the website is designed to be both visually appealing and highly functional, offering a clean and straightforward experience for anyone looking to learn more about the shop.
